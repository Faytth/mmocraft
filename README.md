The client for MeleeCraft. An abandoned project created back in 2013.

Do not use this code for a basis of the "right" way to do things. I'm sure there are many parts of the code base that are poorly implemented (most glaringly the way commits were done. You should prefer small commits that modify a single thing to large commits. Otherwise, your team members (and you later) will not easily be able to make sense of what was done).
